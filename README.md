# opensim-rest-console

According to the available docs under http://opensimulator.org/wiki/RestConsole this is a possible implementation of a REST console for the opensimulator.

## Usage

You need to install the node-rest-client via npm or somehow. Then change the username, password and baseURL constant variables at the top of the source. If your operating system didn't support shebang and env, you also need to change the first line as well.

Launch it, use it, end it with exit at the prompt. 

## Developing

It's not bulletproof. No further development is planned, but who knows.
